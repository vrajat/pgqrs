# Investigations

Research findings, spike results, performance benchmarks, and exploratory work.

## What Goes Here

- Research spikes
- Performance benchmarks
- Proof-of-concept results
- Technology evaluations
- Feasibility studies
- Exploratory prototypes

## Current Investigations

- [Multi-Database Test Infrastructure](multi_db_test_infrastructure.md)
- [SQLx-Inspired API Proposal](sqlx_inspired_api_proposal.md)

## Investigation Document Format

Each investigation should include:

1. **Objective** - What was being investigated
2. **Context** - Why this investigation was needed
3. **Approach** - How the investigation was conducted
4. **Findings** - What was learned
5. **Recommendations** - What should be done based on findings
6. **Metrics/Data** - Performance numbers, benchmarks, etc.
7. **Conclusion** - Summary and next steps
8. **References** - Links to code, external resources

## Archiving

Once an investigation leads to a decision, consider:
1. Creating an ADR to document the decision
2. Moving implementation details to a design doc
3. Archiving the investigation for historical reference
